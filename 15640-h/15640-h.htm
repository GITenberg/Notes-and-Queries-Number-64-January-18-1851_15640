<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>AUTHORSHIP OF HENRY VIII.</h3>

  <p>In my last communication on the subject of <i>Henry VIII.</i>, I
  referred to certain characteristic <i>tricks</i> of Fletcher's style of
  frequent occurrence in that play, and I now beg leave to furnish you with
  a few instances. I wish it, however, to be understood, that I advance
  these merely as illustrative specimens selected at random; as there is
  scarcely a line of the portions of the play I assume to be Fletcher's but
  would furnish some evidence to a diligent student of this writer's style:
  and that, although I think each separate instance as strongly
  characteristic of Fletcher as it is unlike Shakspeare, it is only in
  their aggregate number that I insist upon their importance.</p>

  <p>The first instance to which I call attention is the use of the
  substantive "one" in a manner which, though not very uncommon, is used by
  no writer so frequently as Fletcher. Take the following:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"<i>So</i> great ones."&mdash;<i>Woman's Prize</i>, II. 2.</p>
      <p>"And yet his songs are sad ones."&mdash;<i>Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, II. 4.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and the title of the play, <i>The False One</i>.</p>

  <p>Compare with these from <i>Henry VIII.</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"This night he make a supper, and a great one."&mdash;Act I. 3.</p>
      <p>"Shrewd ones."&mdash;"Lame ones."&mdash;"<i>so</i> great ones."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>
      <p class="i8">"I had my trial,</p>
      <p>And must needs say a noble one."&mdash;Act II. 1.</p>
      <p>"A wife&mdash;a true one."&mdash;Act III. 1.</p>
      <p>"They are a sweet society of fair ones."&mdash;Act I. 4.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Fletcher habitually uses "thousand" without the indefinite article, as
  in the following instances:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Carried before 'em thousand desolations."&mdash;<i>False One</i>, II. 9.</p>
      <p>"Offers herself in thousand safeties to you."&mdash;<i>Rollo</i>, II. 1.</p>
      <p>"This sword shall cut thee into thousand pieces."&mdash;<i>Knight of Malta</i>, IV. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In <i>Henry VIII.</i> we have in the prologue:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6">"Of thousand friends."</p>
      <p>"Cast thousand beams upon me."&mdash;Act IV. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The use of the word "else" is peculiar in its position in
  Fletcher:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"'Twere fit I were hang'd else."&mdash;<i>Rule a Wife</i>, II.</p>
      <p>"I were to blame else."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p>
      <p>"I've lost me end else."&mdash;Act IV.</p>
      <p>"I am wide else."&mdash;<i>Pilgrim</i>, IV. 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In <i>Henry VIII.</i>, the word occurs in precisely the same
  position:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Pray God he do! He'll never know himself, else."&mdash;Act II. 2.</p>
      <p>"I were malicious, else."&mdash;Act IV. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span></p>

  <p>The peculiarly idiomatic expression "I take it" is of frequent
  occurrence in Fletcher, as witness the following:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"This is no lining for a trench, I take it."&mdash;<i>Rule a Wife</i>, III.</p>
      <p>"And you have land i' th' Indies, as I take it."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i> IV.</p>
      <p>"A fault without forgiveness, as I take it."&mdash;<i>Pilgrim</i>, IV. 1.</p>
      <p>"In noble emulation (so I take it)."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i> IV. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In one scene of <i>Henry VIII.</i>, Act I. 3., the expression occurs
  twice: "One would take it;" "There, I take it."</p>

  <p>Of a peculiar manner of introducing a negative condition, one instance
  from Fletcher, and one from <i>Henry VIII.</i> in reference to the same
  substantive, though used in different senses, will suffice:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">"All noble battles,</p>
      <p>Maintain'd in thirst of honour, not of blood."&mdash;<i>Bonduca</i>, V. 1.</p>
      <p class="i8">"And those about her</p>
      <p>From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,</p>
      <p>And by those claim their greatness, not by blood."&mdash;<i>Henry VIII.</i>, V. 4.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Of a kind of parenthetical asseveration, a single instance, also, from
  each will suffice:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"My innocent life (I dare maintain it, Sir)."&mdash;<i>Wife for a Month, IV. 1.</i></p>
      <p>"A woman (I dare say, without vain glory)</p>
      <p>Never yet branded with suspicion."&mdash;<i>Henry VIII., III. 1.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"A great patience," in <i>Henry VIII.</i>, may be paralleled by "a
  brave patience," in <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>: and the expression "aim
  at," <i>occurring at the close of the verse</i> (as, by the bye, almost
  all Fletcher's peculiarities do) as seen in Act III. 1.,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Madam, you wander from the good we aim at,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>is so frequently to be met with in Fletcher, that, having noted four
  instances in the <i>Pilgrim</i>, three in the <i>Custom of the
  Country</i>, and four in the <i>Elder Brother</i>, I thought I had found
  more than enough.</p>

  <p>Now, Sir, on reading <i>Henry VIII.</i>, and meeting with each of
  these instances, I felt that I remembered "the trick of that voice;" and,
  without having at present by me any means for reference, I feel confident
  that of the commonest examples not so many can be found among all the
  rest of the reputed plays of Shakspeare, as in <i>Henry VIII.</i> alone,
  or rather in those parts of <i>Henry VIII.</i> which I reject as
  Shakspeare's; while of the more remarkable, I think I might challenge the
  production of a single instance.</p>

  <p>My original intention in the present paper was merely to call
  attention to a few such expressions as the foregoing; but I cannot resist
  the impulse to quote one or two parallels of a different
  character:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Henry VIII.</i>:</p>
      <p>"The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!"&mdash;Act IV. 2.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Fletcher:</p>
      <p>"The dew of sleep fall gently on you, sweet one!"&mdash;<i>Elder Brother</i>, IV. 3.</p>
      <p>"Blessings from heaven in thousand showers fall on ye!"&mdash;<i>Rollo</i>, II. 3.</p>
      <p>"And all the plagues they can inflict, I wish it,</p>
      <p>Fall thick upon me!"&mdash;<i>Knight of Malta</i>, III. 2.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Henry VIII.</i>:</p>
      <p class="i8">"To-day he puts forth</p>
      <p>The tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms."&mdash;Act III. 2.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Fletcher:</p>
      <p>"My long-since-blasted hopes shoot out in blossoms."&mdash;<i>Rollo</i>, II. 3.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These instances, of course, prove nothing; yet they are worth the
  noting. If, however, I were called upon to produce two passages from the
  whole of Fletcher's writings most strikingly characteristic of his style,
  and not more in expression than in thought, I should fix upon the third
  scene of the first act of <i>Henry VIII.</i>, and the soliloquy of
  Wolsey, Beginning&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In conclusion, allow me to remark, that I am quite content to have
  been anticipated by MR. SPEDDING in this discovery (if discovery you and
  your readers will allow it to be), for the satisfaction I am thereby
  assured of in the concurrence of so acute a critic as himself, and of a
  poet so true as the poet-laureate.</p>

<h3>GRAY'S ELEGY.</h3>

  <p>J.F.M. (Vol. i., p. 101.) remarks, "I would venture to throw out a
  hint, that an edition of this <i>Elegy</i>, exhibiting all the known
  translations, arranged in double columns, might be made a noble monument
  to the memory of Gray." It has been asserted that there is scarcely a
  thought in this <i>Elegy</i> that Gray has not borrowed from some writer,
  ancient or modern and if this be true, I would take the liberty of adding
  a hint to that of J.F.M., namely, that the proposed edition should
  contain a <i>third</i> column, exhibiting all the known plagiarisms in
  this famous <i>Elegy</i>. To begin with the first line&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"The curfew tolls the knell of parting day."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Lord Byron, in his notes to the third canto of <i>Don Juan</i>, says
  that this was adopted from the following passage in Dante's
  <i>Purgatory</i>, canto viii.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>&mdash;&mdash; "si ode squilla di lontano</p>
      <p>Che paja 'l giorno pianger che si muore."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And it is worthy of notice that this passage corresponds with the
  first line of Giannini's translation of the Elegy, as quoted by
  J.F.M.:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Piange la squilla 'l giorno, che si muore."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I must add, however, that long before Lord Byron thought of writing
  <i>Don Juan</i>, Mr. Cary, in his excellent translation of the Italian
  poet, had noticed this plagiarism in Gray; and what is more, had shown
  that the principal thought, the "giorno che si muore," was borrowed by
  Dante from Statius's</p>

<h3>THE NINEVEH MONUMENTS AND MILTON'S NATIVITY
ODE ILLUSTRATED FROM LUCIAN.</h3>

  <p>Layard in his <i>Nineveh</i>, vol. ii., p. 471., in his description of
  "the sacred emblems carried by the priests," says, they are principally
  the fruit or cone of the pine.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"... and the square utensil which, as I have already remarked, appears
  to have been of embossed or engraved metal, or of metal carved to
  represent wicker work, or sometimes actually of wicker work."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He adds, that M. Lajard "has shown the connection between the cone of
  the cypress and the worship of Venus in the religious systems of the
  East;" that it has been suggested that "the square vessel held the holy
  water," that, "however this may be, it is evident from their constant
  occurrence on Assyrian monuments, that they were very important objects
  in religious ceremonies. Any attempt to explain their use and their
  typical <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span> meaning, can at present be little better
  than ingenious speculation."</p>

  <p>There is a passage in Lucian <i>De Dea Syria</i>, §. 13., which may
  serve to elucidate this feature in the Nineveh marbles. He is referring
  to the temple of Hierapolis and a ceremony which Deucalion was said to
  have introduced, as a memorial of the great flood and the escaping of the
  waters:</p>

  <p>"Twice every year water is brought from the sea to the temple. Not
  only the priests, but" all Syria and Arabia, "and many from the country
  beyond the Euphrates come to the sea, and all bring away water, which
  they first pour out in the temple," and then into a chasm which Lucian
  had previously explained had suddenly opened and swallowed up the flood
  of waters which had threatened to destroy the world. Tyndale, in his
  recent book on Sardinia, refers to this passage in support of a similar
  utensil appearing in the Sarde paganism.</p>

  <p>It may be interesting to refer to another passage in the <i>Dea
  Syria</i>, in which Lucian is describing the splendour of the temple of
  Hierapolis; he says that the deities themselves are really
  present:&mdash;</p>

<h3>MINOR NOTES.</h3>

  <p><i>Gaudentio di Lucca.</i>&mdash;Sir James Mackinstosh, in his
  <i>Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy</i>, adverts to the
  belief that Bishop Berkeley was the author of <i>Gaudentio di Lucca</i>,
  but without adopting it.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"A romance," he says, "of which a journey to an Utopia, in the centre
  of Africa, forms the chief part, called <i>The Adventures of Signor
  Gaudentio di Lucca</i>, has been commonly ascribed to him; probably on no
  other ground than its union of pleasing invention with benevolence and
  elegance."&mdash;<i>Works</i>, vol. i. p. 132. ed. 1846.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir J. Mackintosh, like most other modern writers who mention the

  composed) every sheet thereof with his own hand, I find, in a note to Mr.
  R.A. Willmott's volume of the <i>Lives of the English Sacred Poets</i>,
  in that interesting one of George Wither, the following corroboration of
  this singular labour of his: the poem, independent of the address to the
  King and the præmonition, consisting of between nine and ten thousand
  lines, many of which, I doubt not, were the production of his brain while
  he stood at the printing-case. A MS. note of Mr. Park's, in one of the
  many volumes of Wither which I possess, confirms me in this opinion.</p>

  intended to represent Wither, employed one of these presses. Thus, upon

<h3>BURYING IN CHURCH WALLS.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 513.)</p>

  <p>MR. W. DURRANT COOPER has mentioned some instances of burials in the
  walls of churches; it is not however clear whether in these the monument,
  or coffin lid, is in the inside or the outside of the wall.</p>

  <p>Stone coffin lids, with and without effigies, are very frequently
  found placed under low arches hollowed in the wall in the <i>interior</i>
  of the church: tombs placed in the <i>exterior</i> of the wall are much
  less common; and the singularity of their position, leads one to look for
  some peculiar reason for it. Tradition often accounts for it by such
  stories as those mentioned by MR. COOPER. Such is the case with a
  handsome canopied tomb (I think with an effigy) on the south side of the
  choir of the cathedral of Lichfield, where we are told that the person
  interred died under censure of the church. Other instances which I have
  noticed, are, at&mdash;</p>

  <p>Little Casterton, Rutland.&mdash;Tomb, with an effigy, apparently of
  an ecclesiastic, but much decayed, of the 13th century, in the south wall
  of the nave.</p>

  <p>Warbleton, Sussex.&mdash;Circular arch over a sort of altar tomb, no
  effigy remains. Probably of the earlier half of the 13th century. In the
  south wall of chancel.</p>

  <p>Basildon, Berks.&mdash;A very elegant canopy. There was once an
  effigy, now destroyed, with the tomb, and a door made under the canopy!
  About 1300. In the south wall of the chancel.</p>

  <p>Bridewater, Somerset.&mdash;Two arches, with foliations, over effigies
  between them, a door leading, down to a crypt. The effigies are too much
  decayed to enable a decided opinion to be formed as to sex or station. In
  the north wall of north transept. Date probably between 1270 and
  1300.</p>

  <p>St. Stephen's, Vienna.&mdash;A fine tomb, with canopy and effigy, by
  the side of the south door of the nave. Probably of the 14th century.</p>

  <p>I have been disposed to think that the most <!-- Page 38 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span> probable motive which
  may have led to tombs and effigies, sometimes of an elaborate and costly
  character, being placed in such exposed positions, was the desire of
  obtaining the prayers of the passers-by for the soul of the deceased. It
  is worth notice, that the usage seems in England to have been very much
  limited to the 13th, or early part of the 14th century. I should,
  however, be very glad if any one who may possess information bearing on
  the subject would communicate it.</p>

  and cutting turf within the limits of the forest. He calls it "Fenfield,

  of Peter Sterry's <i>Appearance of God to Man in the Gospel</i>, &amp;c.,
  and other his posthumous discourses, 4to. 1710, mention is made of
  certain miscellaneous tracts, letters, &amp;c., taken from original MSS.
  left by him, whose publication was made to depend on the success of the
  above work. Sterry was spoken of by Baxter in complimentary terms,
  notwithstanding his peculiar sentiments and manner of writing; and in a
  MS. note on the title-page of Sterry's <i>Discourse of the Freedom of the
  Will</i>, folio, 1675, he is said to have been "chaplain first to Lord
  Brooke, afterwards to Oliver Cromwell." If any of your readers can say
  whether the "miscellaneous tracts," &amp;c., were ever published, and, if
  not, where the MSS. are likely to be found, with any further information
  concerning him, which is desired by many persons deeply interested in his
  history and writings, it will confer a favour on me.</p>

  lately seen, in the south of France, a she-wolf that had been caught at a
  very early age, and brought up on very friendly terms with a kennel of
  hounds. The animal had come to its maturity when my friend observed it
  and its good understanding with its canine neighbours had never been
  interrupted. So far from it, indeed, that the she-wolf has had and reared
  a litter of pups by one of the dogs, and does duty in hunting as well as
  any dog of the pack. Buffon states that he had found that an experiment
  continued for a considerable time, to bring about the like result between
  the like animals, never showed the least appearance of success. The
  circumstances which he mentions as to the capture and habits of the
  she-wolf are nearly the same as I have above described, and from the
  failure of the experiments, Buffon doubted the possibility of any sexual
  conjunction between these kinds of animals. Some of your correspondents
  may be able to say how far subsequent observation confirms Buffon's
  conclusion.</p>

  <p><i>Genealogy of the Talbots.</i>&mdash;In some of the printed
  genealogies of the Talbots, to whose ancestry you have lately made
  several references, descent is claimed for that noble family from the
  emperors of the East, through Anne, wife of Henry I., King of France, and
  daughter of Iaroslaf, or Georges, King of Russia, whose father, the great
  Vladimir, married Anne, sister of Basilius, Emperor of Byzantium.</p>

  <p>Now that excellent authority, <i>L'Art de Vérifier les Dates</i>,
  gives the date of 988 for the conquest of the Chersonese by Vladimir and
  his marriage with the emperor's sister, and that of 978 for the birth of
  Iaroslaf, who must, therefore, be a son of one of the many concubines
  mentioned in that work as preceding his wife Anne.</p>

  <p>Can the rare honour of descent from the Eastern emperors be
  substantiated by the correspondents who appear to take interest in the
  pedigree of this house?</p>

  <p>I may add, that <i>L'Art de Vérifier les Dates</i>, though seldom
  incorrect, seems to err when it asserts Enguerherde, wife of the
  above-named Iaroslaf, to be <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page40"></a>{40}</span> the daughter of Olaus, or Olaf, "King of
  <i>Norway</i>, and not of <i>Sweden</i>," as the <i>Heims Kringla</i> of
  Snorro Sturleson gives a long account of the betrothal of Ingigerd or
  Enguerherde, daughter of Olaf Ericson, King of <i>Sweden</i>, to St.
  Olaf, King of <i>Norway</i>, and of her subsequent marriage to Iaroslaf,

  <i>George</i> Robertson, of St. Anne's, Soho, who lived in the middle of
  the last century, and married Elizabeth Love, of Ormsby, co. Norfolk. He
  was uncle, I believe, to Mr. Robertson Barclay (who assumed the last
  name), of Keavil, co. Fife, and nearly related, though I cannot say in
  what degree, to William Robertson, of Richmond, whose daughter Isabella
  married David Dundas, created a baronet by George III., and one of whose
  granddaughters was married to Sir James Moncreiff, and another to Dr.
  Sumner, the present Archbishop of Canterbury. This William Robertson, I
  believe sold the Muirtown property. Is he one of those mentioned in the
  work to which A.R.X. has referred me? and was he the <i>first</i> cousin
  to Robertson the historian? Perhaps A.R.X. can also say whether the arms
  properly borne by the Muirtown branch are those given to them in Burke's
  <i>Armory</i>, viz. Gu. three crescents interlaced or, between as many
  wolves' heads erased arg. armed and langued az., all within a bordure of
  the third, charged with eight mullets of the first. The late Rev. Love
  Robertson, Prebendary of Hereford (son of the above George Robertson),
  was accustomed to use: Gu. three wolves' heads erased arg., armed and
  langued az., which are the arms of the original stock of Strowan. As I am
  entitled to quarter his coat, I should be glad to know the correct
  blazonry.</p>

  at which he was charged with having indulged in forbidden slumbers. The
  tradition of course adds, indeed this is its point, that, upon inquiry,
  it was found that the famous horary monitor of London city had, "for that
  night only," actually treated those whose ears were open, with the, till
  then, unheard of phenomenon of "thirteen to the dozen." Can any of your

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>

<h3>DRAGONS.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 517.)</p>

  <p>The subject on which R.S. jun. writes in No. 61. is one of so much
  interest in many points of view, that I hope that a few notices relating
  to it may not be considered unworthy of insertion in "NOTES AND
  QUERIES."</p>

  <p>In Murray's <i>Handbook of Northern Italy</i>, mention is made, in the
  account of the church of St. Maria delle Grazie, near Mantua, of a
  stuffed lizard, crocodile, or other reptile, which is preserved suspended
  in the church. This is said to have been killed in the adjacent swamps,
  about the year 1406. It is stated to be six or seven feet long.</p>

  <p>Eight or ten years ago, I saw an animal of the same order, and about
  the same size, hanging from the roof of the cathedral of Abbeville, in
  Picardy. I then took it for a small crocodile, but I cannot say
  positively that it was one. I am not sure whether it still remains in the
  cathedral. I do not know whether any legend exists respecting this
  specimen, or whether it owed its distinguished post to its being deemed
  an appropriate ornament.</p>

  <p>At the west door of the cathedral of Cracow are hanging some bones,
  said to have belonged to the dragon which inhabited the cave at the foot
  of the rock (the Wawel) on which the cathedral and the royal castle
  stand; and was destroyed by Krak, the founder of the city. I regret that
  my want of osteological science prevented me from ascertaining to what
  animal these bones had belonged. I thought them the bones of some small
  species of whale.</p>

  <p>I hope that some competent observer may inform us of what animals
  these and the lindwurm at Brünn are the remains.</p>

  <p>It has struck me as possible that the real history of these crocodiles
  or alligators, if they are such, may be, that they were brought home by
  crusaders as specimens of dragons, just as Henry the Lion, Duke of
  Brunswick, brought from the Holy Land the antelope's horn which had been
  palmed upon <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span> him as a specimen of a griffin's claw, and
  which may still be seen in the cathedral of that city. That they should
  afterwards be fitted with appropriate legends, is not surprising.</p>

  <p>Some years since, when walking down the valley of St. Nicholas, on the
  south side of the Valais, my guide, a native of the valley, pointed out
  to me a wood on the mountain side, and told me that therein dwelt great
  serpents, about 24 feet long, which carried off lambs from the pastures.
  He had, however, never seen one of these monsters, but had only seen
  those who had, and I failed in procuring any testimony of a more decisive
  character. My guide, however, affirmed that their existence was generally
  believed in the valley.</p>

<h3>ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY NAME OF BACON.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., p. 247.)</p>

  <p>The Query proposed by NOCAB evidently possesses some interest, having
  already elicited two or three replies. I trust, therefore, I shall be
  excused for submitting yet another solution, which appears to me more
  satisfactory, if not <i>conclusive</i>. The answers to such questions are
  for the most part merely ingenious <i>conjectures</i>; but these to be of
  weight, should be supported by antiquarian learning. They claim perhaps
  more regard when they seem to elucidate collateral difficulties; but are
  of most value when <i>authenticated</i> by independent evidence,
  especially the evidence of <i>documents</i> or of <i>facts</i>.
  Fortunately, in the case before us, all these desiderata are
  supplied.</p>

  <p>Old Richard Verstegan, famous for Saxon lore and archæological
  research, explains it thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Bacon, <i>of the Beechen tree</i>, anciently called BUCON; and,
  whereas swinesflesh is now called by the name of BACON, it grew only at
  the first unto such as were fatted with BUCON or
  <i>beechmast</i>."&mdash;Chap. ix. p. 299.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is one agreeable feature in this explanation, viz., that it
  professes somewhat naturally to account for the mysterious relation
  between the flesh of the unclean animal, and the name of a very ancient
  and honourable family. But its chief value is to be found in the singular
  <i>authentication</i> of it which I accidentally discovered in Collins's
  <i>Baronetage</i>. In the very ample and particular account there given
  of the pedigree of the Premier Baronet, it will be seen that the
  <i>first</i> man who assumed the surname of Bacon, was one William (temp.
  Rich. I.), a great grandson of the Grimbaldus, who came over with the
  Conqueror and settled in Norfolk. Of course there was <i>some</i> reason
  for his taking that name; and though Collins makes no comment on it, he
  does in fact unconsciously supply that reason (elucidated by Verstegan)
  by happily noting of this <i>sole</i> individual, that he <i>bore for his
  arms</i>, "argent, <i>a beech tree</i> proper!" Thank you, Mr. Collins!
  thank you kindly, Richard Verstegan! You are both excellent and honest
  men. You cannot have been in collusion. You have not, until <i>now</i>,
  even reaped the merit of truthfulness and accuracy, which you silently
  reflect upon each other. The family name, Bacon, then, undoubtedly
  signifies "of the beechen tree," and is therefore of the same class with
  many others such as ash, beech, &amp;c., latinized in ancient records by
  De Fraxino, De Fago, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The motto of the Somersetshire Bacons, noticed by NOCAB, when read as
  written, is supposed to be in the <i>ablative</i> case; when transposed,
  the evident ellipse may be supplied <i>ad libitum</i>. From Grimbaldus,
  downwards, it does not appear that these <i>beechen</i> men ever
  signalized themselves by <i>deeds of arms</i>, the favourite boast of
  heralds and genealogists. Nor indeed could we expect them to have "hearts
  of <i>oak</i>." But several have rendered the name illustrious by their
  contributions to literature, science, and the fine arts. Its
  <i>appropriateness</i>, therefore, must be apology for the motto; which,
  like most others, is by no means too modest and unassuming.</p>

  <p>Duly blushing, I subscribe myself, yours,</p>

  <p class="author">PROBA CONSCIENTIA.</p>

  <p>P.S. The pedigree of the Norfolk Bacons is one of the most
  <i>perfect</i> in the Herald's College. Any of your readers fond of
  genealogy might find himself repaid in seeking further information
  regarding the <i>particular coat of arms</i> above referred to, and might
  throw still more light on the subject.</p>

  <p>In Vol. ii., p. 247., your correspondent, NOCAB, quotes (without
  reference) the remark <i>en passant</i> of a previous correspondent "that
  the word <i>bacon</i> had the obsolete signification of 'dried wood.'" I
  have searched in vain for this allusion in your preceding Numbers.<a
  name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The information
  is too curious, however, to be lost sight of. The <i>Saxon</i> word
  <i>bacon</i> is, without doubt, simply and purely
  <i>beechen</i>&mdash;pertaining to, or relating to the beech tree.</p>

  <p>It is probable enough, therefore, that the word <i>has</i> borne the
  signification of "dried wood." But it is very desirable to know on what
  authority the assertion rests. Will your correspondent refer us to the
  book? Or can any of your learned readers say how, where, and when
  <i>bacon</i> has signified "dried wood?"</p>

  <p>The subject is well worth the bestowal of some pains upon its
  elucidation; for the meaning and derivation of the word <i>bacon</i>,
  both as a substantive noun and as a proper name, have been frequently
  discussed by etymologists and philologists for the last 300 years; and
  yet, apparently, without any satisfactory determination of the question.
  The family is ancient, and has been highly distinguished <!-- Page 42
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span> in literature,
  and science and art. The pedigree is one of the most perfect on record.
  But Lord Bacon himself, "who knew everything" else, knew nothing of his
  own name.</p>

  it is found in a quarto one bearing date 1707, printed by the Queen's

  immediately before the Articles, and is simply entitled, "At the

  <p>"<i>Aver.</i>"&mdash;<i>Hogs not Pigs</i> (Vol. ii., p.
  461.).&mdash;In Wensleydale, North Yorkshire, the thin oat-cake (common
  in many mountainous parts of England) is called "<i>aver-cake</i>," or
  "<i>haver-cake</i>." The Loyal Dales Volunteers were surnamed "The
  Haver-cake Lads." Previously to seeing the Note of G.M., I imagined the
  "aver" to be derived from "avena" (Lat.), "avoine" (Fr.). What
  <i>dictionary</i> defines "aver" (French) as denoting the <i>annual</i>
  stock or produce of a farm?</p>

  <p class="author">D.2.</p>

  <p>E.M., in his Note on J. MN.'s remarks on hogs, mentions that the term
  <i>aver</i>, <i>averium</i>, is still used in Guernsey. Is not this word
  closely connected with the <i>Eber</i> of the German Jägers?</p>

  <p class="author">E.H.K.</p>

  <p><i>Pilgarlic</i> (Vol. ii., p. 393.).&mdash;Sir John Denham spelt this
  word <i>Peel</i>-garlick&mdash;it may be found in one of his
  <i>Directions to a Painter</i>&mdash;but the passage in which it appears
  is scarcely fit for quotation. The George of the couplet referred to was
  Albemarle, who had been wounded during the fight in the part of his
  person which Hudibras alludes to when he tells us that one wound
  there</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8">"hurts honour more</p>
      <p>Than twenty wounds laid on before."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Denham seems to compare Albemarle's wounded buttocks to a peeled
  onion! The resemblance (to Denham) would account for his use of the word
  in this instance; but it is pretty evident that the word was not coined

  <p><i>Collar of Esses</i> (Vol. ii., p. 393.).&mdash;With reference to
  the suggestion in No. 54., to give examples of effigies bearing the

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"In Northleigh church, beneath an arch between the chancel and a
  chapel, is a fine perpendicular tomb, with two recumbent figures in
  alabaster,&mdash;a knight in armour, with the Collar of SS; the lady with
  a rich turban and reticulated head-dress, and also with the Collar of SS.
  The figures are Lord and Lady Wilmot; and attached to the monument are
  two small figures of angels holding shields of arms; on one is a spread
  eagle, on the other three cockle shells, with an engrailed band."</p>

  <p><i>Filthy Gingram</i> (Vol. ii., p. 467.).&mdash;The name "toad-flax"
  is evidently put by mistake, in Owen's <i>Dictionary</i>, for
  "toad-stool," a fungus, the <i>Agaricus virosus</i> of Linnæus. The
  common name in the North of England is "poisonous toad-stool." It is a
  virulent poison. See * 248. 407, 408., in Sowerby's <i>English

  <i>es</i>) from "Occasio: Drama, P. Joannis David, Soc. Jesu Sacerd.

  the statement in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of Dec. 27th last, that
  that excellent work, <i>Holy Living</i>, which I have always understood
  to be Bishop Taylor's, "is now <i>known</i>" (so says a constant reader)
  "not to be the production of that great prelate, but to have been written
  by a Spanish friar. On this account it is not included in the works of
  Bishop Taylor, lately printed at the Oxford University Press." I do not
  possess the Oxford edition here mentioned, so cannot test the accuracy of
  the assertion in the last sentence but if the first part of the above
  extract be correct, it is, to say the least, singular that Mr. Bohn, in
  his recent edition of the work, should be entirely silent on the subject.
  I should like to know who and what is this "Spanish friar?" has he not "a
  local habitation and a name?"</p>

  which Archdeacon Churton, in <i>A Letter to Joshua Watson, Esq.</i>, has
  shown, with great acuteness and learning, was in reality a compilation
  from a work written by a Spanish Jesuit, named John Eusebius Nieremberg.

  <p><i>Portrait of Bishop Henchman</i> (Vol. iii., p. 8.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent Y.Y. is informed, that there is in the collection of the
  Earl of Clarendon, at the Grove, a full-length portrait of Bishop
  Henchman, by Sir Peter Lely. This picture, doubtless, belonged to the
  Chancellor Clarendon. Lord Clarendon, in his <i>History of the
  Rebellion</i>, b. xiii. (vol. vi. p. 540. ed. Oxford, 1826), describes
  the share which Dr. Henchman, then a prebendary of Salisbury, had in
  facilitating the escape of Charles II., after the battle of Worcester.
  Dr. Henchman conducted the king to a place called Heale, near Salisbury,
  then belonging to Serjeant Hyde, afterwards made chief justice of the
  King's Bench by his cousin the chancellor.</p>

  been printed lately in a work entitled <i>The Sussex Garland</i>,
  published by James Taylor, formerly an eminent bookseller at Brighton,
  but now removed to Newick, Sussex. The lines appear to have been written
  on Mrs. Grace Butler, who died at Rowdel, in Sussex, in the 86th year of
  her age, by Alexander Pope, but, according to Taylor, not inserted in any
  edition of Pope's works. The lines will be found in the 9th and 10th Nos.

  <p>The above I have extracted from the account of him given in the

  <p>Passage in Bishop Butler (Vol. ii., p. 464.).&mdash;The "peculiar
  term" referred to by Bishop Butler is evidently the verb "to Blackguard."
  It is for this reason that he inserts the condition, "when the person it
  respects is present." We may abuse, revile, vituperate an absent person;
  but we can only "blackguard" a man when he is present. The word
  "blackguard" is not recognised by Johnson. Richardson inserts it as a
  noun, but not as a verb.</p>

  <p><i>Did Elizabeth visit Bacon at Twickenham Park?</i> (Vol. ii., pp.
  408. 468.).&mdash;To this question your correspondent J.I.D. replies with
  a quotation from Nicols (edition of 1823), who dates her visit in 1592 or
  1593. I had looked into Nichols's first edition (1788) without finding
  the subject mentioned; and I am now inclined to think, as at first, that
  it is altogether a misapprehension. Sir Francis Bacon, in <i>His Apologie
  in Certaine Imputations concerning the late Earl of Essex, written to the
  Right Hon. his very Good Lord the Earle of Devonshire, Lord-lieutenant of
  Ireland</i>. Lond. 1604, in 16mo. pp. 74., says, at p. 32.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"A little before that time, being about the middle of Michaelmas
  terme, her Maiestie had a purpose to dine at my Lodge at Twickn&#257;
  Parke, at which time I had (though I professe not to be a poet) prepared
  a Sonnet, directly tending and alluding to draw on her Maiesties
  reconciliation to my Lord," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This I conceive to have reference to an intention of Elizabeth, rather
  than to an accomplished fact.</p>

  <p>At p. 14. of this work, Bacon says he had sold Twickenham park some
  time ago to Reynold Nicholas. I consider Lysons to have been the first
  author who mentions the subject and at <i>Environs</i>, vol. iii. (1795),
  p. 565., there is a note: "From the information of the Earl of Orford."
  And I therefore conclude it to have been some mistake of Lord
  Orford's.</p>

  <p><i>Mock-Beggar</i> (Vol. ii., p. 478.).&mdash;The origin of this term
  was discussed in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> in 1840. Two localities
  so called were cited (vol. xiv. p. 114.), with the opinion of Sir William
  Burrell, that some buildings so named at Brighton had been "a mendicant
  priory." Another writer (p. 331.) suggested that the term was applied to
  country houses when deserted or unoccupied; or to rocks, as one near
  Bakewell, where the semblance of a ham might attract a wayfarer from the
  high road, only to deceive his expectations of relief.</p>

  under water, like Port Meadow, on the opposite side of the river: so if

  <p><i>Abbot's House at Buckden</i> (Vol. ii., p. 494.).&mdash;MR. C.H.
  COOPER asks, "will M.C.R. explain his allusion to the Abbot's House at
  Buckden?" Being only an occasional visitor there, I can give no other
  explanation than it is universally called so by the inhabitants of the
  place. The house is very low-roomed, and only one story high; it has been
  compoed over, so that there is nothing very ancient in the look of the
  brickwork, excepting the chimneys, which form a cluster in the centre.
  The door I mentioned, evidently is an ancient one. A good deal of iron
  about it, and in square compartments.</p>

  <p>When I was there recently, I was informed of a discovery in a
  public-house <i>formerly</i> called the Lion&mdash;now, the <i>Lamb</i>.
  A gentleman in the place came into possession of some pamphlets
  respecting Buckden; in one of which it is said, that this house was
  originally the hostel where the visitors and domestics used to go when
  the bishop had not room at the palace for them, and that it would be
  found there was an "Agnus Dei" in the ceiling of one of the lower rooms.
  The consequence was, search was made for it: and what seemed a plain
  boss, where two beams crossed each other, on being cleansed and scraped,
  turned out to be as the book said, and which I saw only last week. The
  clergyman has the pamphlet above alluded to. Whether this, and the
  abbot's house, belonged to the palace I cannot say. The road now runs
  between them.</p>

  <p>The "Agnus Dei" is seven or eight inches in diameter; the lamb,
  &amp;c., in the centre, and the words "Ecce Agnus Dei" in a circular
  border round it.</p>

  <p>This is all the information I can now give.</p>

  <p><i>Bab in the Bowster</i> (Vol. ii., p. 518.).&mdash;In your valuable

  country at least. He says "it is now danced with a handkerchief instead
  of a cushion," whereas the fact is I have never seen it danced but with a
  pillow, as its name "Bab in the Bowster (Anglice bolster)" would seem to
  denote. The manner of dancing it is, the company having formed itself
  into a circle, one, either male or female, goes into the centre, carrying
  a pillow, and dances round the circle with a sort of shuffling quick
  step, while the others sing,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <p>Wha learn'd you to dance, Bab in the Bowster brawly?"</p>

  </div>
  <p>To which the dancer replies:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Mother learn'd me to dance, me to dance, me to dance,</p>
      <p>Mother learn'd me to dance, Bab in the Bowster brawly."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>He or she then lays down the pillow before one of the opposite sex,
  when they both kneel on it and kiss; the person to whom the pillow has
  been presented going over the above again, &amp;c, till the company
  tires.</p>

  <p>I may add that the above is a favourite dance here, particularly among
  young people, and at children's parties in particular it is never
  omitted. If your correspondent wishes the air to which it is danced, I
  shall be glad to send it to him.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Mr. Disraeli's work, entitled <i>Commentaries on the Life and Reign of
  Charles the First</i>, has been pronounced by one of the great critical
  authorities of our own days, "the most important work" on the subject
  that modern times have produced. Those who differ from Mr. Disraeli's
  view of the character of the king and the part he played in the great
  drama of his age may, in some degree, dissent from this eulogy. None
  will, however, deny that the work, looking to its anecdotical character,
  and the great use made in it of sources of information hitherto
  unemployed, is one of the most amusing as well as interesting histories
  of that eventful period. While those who share with the editor, Mr. B.
  Disraeli, and many reflecting men, the opinion that in the great
  questions which are now agitating the public mind, history is only
  repeating itself; and that the "chapters <i>on the Genius of the Papacy;
  on the Critical Position of our earlier Protestant Sovereigns with regard
  to their Roman Catholic Subjects</i>, from the consequences of the oaths
  of Allegiance and Supremacy; <i>on the Study of Polemical Divinity
  prevalent at the commencement of the Seventeenth Century</i>, and kindred
  themes, are, in fact, the history of the events, the thoughts, the
  passions, and the perplexities of the present agitated epoch," will agree
  that the republication of the work at this moment is at once opportune
  and acceptable.</p>

  which Percy's work has continued to enjoy ever since its first
  appearance, (for have we not Washbourne's handsome reprint of it,
  published within this year or two?) it must be the quaint and racy
  melodies, the "old antique strains," to which these fine old ballads were
  anciently sung. Dr. Rimbault, who combines great musical acquirements
  with a rich store of antiquarian knowledge, in giving us these, has
  produced a work as carefully executed as it is original in its character;
  one which can only be exceeded in interest by the <i>Musical
  Illustrations of Shakspeare's Plays</i>, which we are glad to see
  promised from the same competent authority.</p>

  <p>We are at length enabled to announce that <i>The Treatise on
  Equivocation</i>, so often referred to in our columns, is about to be
  published under the editorship of Mr. Jardine, whose attention has long
  been directed to it from its connexion with the Gunpowder Conspiracy; and
  whose intimate acquaintance with that subject, as shown in his
  <i>Criminal Trials</i>, is a sufficient pledge for his ability to do
  justice to this curious and important historical document.</p>

  <p>We regret to learn, from the <i>Catalogue of the Museum of Mediæval
  Art, collected by the late Mr. Cottingham</i>, which has been very
  carefully drawn up, with a preface by Mr. Shaw, that, if the Family are
  disappointed in disposing of the Museum to the Government, or by private
  contract, it will be submitted to Public Sale in April next, and a
  Collection of the most ample and varied examples of Mediæval Architecture
  ever brought together, which has been formed at a vast outlay both of
  labour and cost, will be dispersed, and be thereby rendered inaccessible
  and valueless to the architectural student.</p>

  <p>The Rev. W.H. Kelke has published some <i>Notices of Sepulchral
  Monuments in English Churches</i>, a work which is not intended for
  professed antiquaries, but for that large class of persons who, although
  they have some taste for the subject of which it treats, have neither
  time nor inclination to enter deeply into it, and as will, we have no
  doubt, be very acceptable to those to whom it is immediately
  addressed.</p>

  <p>We regret to announce the death of one of our earliest and most valued
  contributors, Professor T.S. Davies of Woolwich. "Probably few men in
  England," says the <i>Athenæum</i>, "were better versed in the methods of
  the old geometers, or possessed a more critical appreciation of their
  relative merits." His death is a great loss to geometrical science, as
  well as to a large circle of friends.</p>

  <p>We have received the following Catalogues:&mdash;Stacey and Co. (19.
  Southampton Street, Strand) Catalogue of Books chiefly relating to
  History, Commerce, and Legislation; G. Bumstead's (205. High Holborn)
  Catalogue of Interesting and Rare Books on the Occult Sciences, America,
  Asia, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h3>

  <p><i>To meet the wishes of many friends, and to avoid the inconvenience
  arising from the diversity of prices in our Monthly Parts, we propose in
  future to publish a fifth, or Supplementary Number, every Month in which
  there are only four Saturdays. By this arrangement our Monthly Parts will
  be of the uniform price of One shilling and Three pence, with the
  exception of those for January and July, which will include the Index of
  the preceding half-year at the price of One shilling and Ninepence each.
  Thus the yearly subscription to </i>NOTES AND QUERIES<i>, either in
  unstamped Weekly Numbers or Monthly Parts, will be </i>SIXTEEN
  SHILLINGS<i>. The subscription for the Stamped Edition, with which
  Gentlemen may be supplied regularly by giving their Orders direct to the
  Publisher, </i>MR. GEORGE BELL, 186. Fleet Street<i> (accompanied by a
  Post Office Order), is One pound and Fourpence for a twelve-month, or Ten
  shillings and Two pence for six months</i>.</p>

  <p>REPLIED RECEIVED.&mdash;<i>It has been suggested to us that we should
  here acknowledge all communications received by us. We would willingly do
  so, but that, from their number, such acknowledgment would necessarily
  occupy far more space than our readers would like to see so employed. But
  we propose in future to notice all replies that have reached us; by which
  means those who </i>have replied<i> will be aware that their
  communications have come to hand, and those who are </i>about to <!--

  reply<i> will be enabled to judge whether or not they have been
  anticipated. The following have reached us between the publication of our

  no means agree with the writer in his views of the property of the Crown.
  The Queen behaved most kindly and liberally on the occasion of the late

  yet aware of this arrangement, which will enable them to receive

  <p>The Tomb of Geoffrey Chaucer in Westminster Abbey is fast mouldering

  honour Chaucer may be kind enough to remit to them.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
